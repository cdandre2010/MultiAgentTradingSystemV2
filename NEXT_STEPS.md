# Next Steps for Multi-Agent Trading System V2

## Current Development Status: ConversationalAgent Integration with Data/Feature Agent Completed ✅

We have successfully implemented the ConversationalAgent integration with the Data/Feature Agent following Test-Driven Development methodology. All tests are passing, including integration tests with real LLM API calls. The ConversationalAgent can now handle data-related queries, create visualization requests, and provide explanations of technical indicators.

## Next Focus: Complete Basic Frontend and Visualization Components

### Step 1: Complete Basic Frontend (Issue 1.4)

Before implementing advanced frontend visualization components, we need to complete the basic frontend implementation:

1. Set up React project with create-react-app:
   - Initialize project structure
   - Configure build system
   - Set up development environment

2. Create basic authentication components:
   - Login form with JWT token handling
   - Registration interface
   - User profile management
   - Password reset functionality

3. Implement API client for backend communication:
   - Create base client class with authentication headers
   - Add request/response interceptors for error handling
   - Implement endpoints for user management and basic data retrieval
   - Set up token refresh mechanism

4. Add basic routing with React Router:
   - Protected routes for authenticated users
   - Public routes for login/registration
   - 404 and error pages
   - Route history management

5. Set up state management with React Context:
   - User authentication context
   - Application settings context
   - Create reusable hooks for common operations
   - Implement persistent storage for settings

### Step 2: Implement Frontend Visualization Components for Data/Feature Agent (Issue 3.2.2)

1. Create visualization components in the frontend:
   - Market data charts (candlestick, line, etc.)
   - Indicator overlays (moving averages, Bollinger bands)
   - Indicator plots (RSI, MACD, stochastic)
   - Strategy parameter exploration tools

2. Implement API endpoints to serve visualization data:
   ```python
   @router.post("/api/visualize/indicator")
   async def visualize_indicator(request: IndicatorVisualizationRequest):
       """Create visualization data for a technical indicator."""
       # Route to DataFeatureAgent through MasterAgent
       # Return formatted visualization data for frontend
   ```

3. Create conversation flows for visualization requests:
   ```
   User: "I want to create a strategy using RSI on Bitcoin hourly data"
   
   ConversationalAgent -> DataFeatureAgent: check_data_availability
   DataFeatureAgent -> ConversationalAgent: availability_result
   
   ConversationalAgent -> User: "I can help with that. I've confirmed we have hourly 
                          Bitcoin data available. The RSI indicator requires closing 
                          prices. Would you like to see a visualization of RSI 
                          for Bitcoin over the past month?"
   
   User: "Yes, please show me"
   
   ConversationalAgent -> DataFeatureAgent: create_visualization
   DataFeatureAgent -> ConversationalAgent: visualization_data
   
   ConversationalAgent -> User: [Presents visualization and continues strategy creation]
   ```

### Step 2: Frontend Data Visualization Integration

1. Create visualization components in the frontend:
   - Market data charts (candlestick, line, etc.)
   - Indicator overlays (moving averages, Bollinger bands)
   - Indicator plots (RSI, MACD, stochastic)
   - Strategy parameter exploration tools

2. Implement API endpoints to serve visualization data:
   ```python
   @router.post("/api/visualize/indicator")
   async def visualize_indicator(request: IndicatorVisualizationRequest):
       """Create visualization data for a technical indicator."""
       # Route to DataFeatureAgent through MasterAgent
       # Return formatted visualization data for frontend
   ```

3. Create interactive strategy builder UI that leverages DataFeatureAgent capabilities

### Step 3: Implement Code Generation Agent

1. Create `src/agents/code_agent.py` to:
   - Generate trading strategy code from strategy specifications
   - Create backtesting scripts for strategies
   - Produce performance analysis code

2. Follow TDD methodology:
   - Create tests for code generation patterns
   - Implement agent based on test requirements
   - Integrate with MasterAgent and other agents

### Step 4: Additional Enhancements

1. Add machine learning feature extraction capabilities to DataFeatureAgent:
   - Time series pattern recognition
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Automated feature engineering

2. Improve strategy validation with advanced techniques:
   - Walk-forward optimization
   - Monte Carlo simulation support
   - Stress testing functionality

## Task Dependencies and Sequencing

The following shows the correct sequence for completing frontend-related issues:

```
Issue 1.4: Basic Frontend
  └─> Issue 3.2.2: Frontend Visualization Components
       └─> Issue 2.9: Strategy Creation Frontend
```

Each task builds upon the previous one, creating a logical development progression:
1. First establish the basic frontend infrastructure
2. Then add specialized visualization components
3. Finally integrate everything into the complete strategy creation interface

## Development Guidelines

1. Continue using Test-Driven Development approach:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement features to pass tests
   - Refactor code while maintaining test coverage

2. Follow established code patterns:
   - Agent-based architecture 
   - Message-passing for inter-agent communication
   - Service-based implementation for specialized functionality
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Component-based frontend development

3. Maintain comprehensive documentation:
   - Update progress tracking
   - Document API endpoints
   - Create usage examples for new features
   - Include frontend component documentation
