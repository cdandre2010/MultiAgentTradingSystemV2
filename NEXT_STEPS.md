# Next Steps for Multi-Agent Trading System V2

## Current Development Status: Basic Frontend Implementation Completed ✅

We have successfully implemented the basic frontend foundation with React, including user authentication components, API client, routing, and state management. This provides the infrastructure necessary for more advanced frontend features.

## Next Focus: Frontend Visualization Components

### Step 1: Implement Frontend Visualization Components for Data/Feature Agent (Issue 3.2.2)

Now that the basic frontend structure is in place, we can implement the specialized visualization components:

1. Create React chart components for market data:
   - Candlestick charts for price data
   - Line charts for time series
   - Volume charts
   - Multi-timeframe support

2. Implement technical indicator visualization:
   - Trend indicators (moving averages, MACD)
   - Momentum indicators (RSI, stochastic)
   - Volatility indicators (Bollinger Bands, ATR)
   - Volume indicators (OBV, volume profile)

3. Build interactive parameter controls:
   - Parameter input forms
   - Real-time parameter adjustment
   - Preset management
   - Save/load configuration

4. Create API endpoints for visualization data:
   - Connect to existing DataFeatureAgent
   - Implement data formatting for frontend charts
   - Create WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Add caching for performance optimization

1. Create visualization components in the frontend:
   - Market data charts (candlestick, line, etc.)
   - Indicator overlays (moving averages, Bollinger bands)
   - Indicator plots (RSI, MACD, stochastic)
   - Strategy parameter exploration tools

2. Implement API endpoints to serve visualization data:
   ```python
   @router.post("/api/visualize/indicator")
   async def visualize_indicator(request: IndicatorVisualizationRequest):
       """Create visualization data for a technical indicator."""
       # Route to DataFeatureAgent through MasterAgent
       # Return formatted visualization data for frontend
   ```

3. Create conversation flows for visualization requests:
   ```
   User: "I want to create a strategy using RSI on Bitcoin hourly data"
   
   ConversationalAgent -> DataFeatureAgent: check_data_availability
   DataFeatureAgent -> ConversationalAgent: availability_result
   
   ConversationalAgent -> User: "I can help with that. I've confirmed we have hourly 
                          Bitcoin data available. The RSI indicator requires closing 
                          prices. Would you like to see a visualization of RSI 
                          for Bitcoin over the past month?"
   
   User: "Yes, please show me"
   
   ConversationalAgent -> DataFeatureAgent: create_visualization
   DataFeatureAgent -> ConversationalAgent: visualization_data
   
   ConversationalAgent -> User: [Presents visualization and continues strategy creation]
   ```

### Step 2: Frontend Data Visualization Integration

1. Create visualization components in the frontend:
   - Market data charts (candlestick, line, etc.)
   - Indicator overlays (moving averages, Bollinger bands)
   - Indicator plots (RSI, MACD, stochastic)
   - Strategy parameter exploration tools

2. Implement API endpoints to serve visualization data:
   ```python
   @router.post("/api/visualize/indicator")
   async def visualize_indicator(request: IndicatorVisualizationRequest):
       """Create visualization data for a technical indicator."""
       # Route to DataFeatureAgent through MasterAgent
       # Return formatted visualization data for frontend
   ```

3. Create interactive strategy builder UI that leverages DataFeatureAgent capabilities

### Step 3: Implement Code Generation Agent

1. Create `src/agents/code_agent.py` to:
   - Generate trading strategy code from strategy specifications
   - Create backtesting scripts for strategies
   - Produce performance analysis code

2. Follow TDD methodology:
   - Create tests for code generation patterns
   - Implement agent based on test requirements
   - Integrate with MasterAgent and other agents

### Step 4: Additional Enhancements

1. Add machine learning feature extraction capabilities to DataFeatureAgent:
   - Time series pattern recognition
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Automated feature engineering

2. Improve strategy validation with advanced techniques:
   - Walk-forward optimization
   - Monte Carlo simulation support
   - Stress testing functionality

## Task Dependencies and Sequencing

The following shows the correct sequence for completing frontend-related issues:

```
Issue 1.4: Basic Frontend
  └─> Issue 3.2.2: Frontend Visualization Components
       └─> Issue 2.9: Strategy Creation Frontend
```

Each task builds upon the previous one, creating a logical development progression:
1. First establish the basic frontend infrastructure
2. Then add specialized visualization components
3. Finally integrate everything into the complete strategy creation interface

## Development Guidelines

1. Continue using Test-Driven Development approach:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement features to pass tests
   - Refactor code while maintaining test coverage

2. Follow established code patterns:
   - Agent-based architecture 
   - Message-passing for inter-agent communication
   - Service-based implementation for specialized functionality
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Component-based frontend development

3. Maintain comprehensive documentation:
   - Update progress tracking
   - Document API endpoints
   - Create usage examples for new features
   - Include frontend component documentation
