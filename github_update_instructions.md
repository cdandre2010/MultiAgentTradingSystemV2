# Instructions for Updating GitHub Issues

I've created a comprehensive GitHub project structure in `github_project_issues.md` that:

1. Maintains your existing milestone and issue structure
2. Matches the implementation plan phases
3. Adds new issues for the knowledge-driven approach
4. Includes dependencies between issues

## How to Update GitHub

### For Existing Issues (1.1-5.5)
1. Compare your current GitHub issues with the updated descriptions
2. Update the descriptions and implementation steps where applicable
3. Update the status of each issue to match the current progress
4. Add dependencies between issues as indicated

### For New Issues (2.4-2.8, 2.10)
These represent the knowledge-driven approach pivot:

- **Issue 2.4: Comprehensive Strategy Model Enhancement** - High priority
- **Issue 2.5: Neo4j Knowledge Graph Enhancement** - High priority
- **Issue 2.6: Strategy Repository Implementation** - High priority
- **Issue 2.7: Knowledge-Driven ConversationalAgent** - Medium priority
- **Issue 2.8: Knowledge-Based ValidationAgent** - Medium priority
- **Issue 2.10: Strategy Templates System** - Medium priority

Create these as new issues in your GitHub project.

### Suggested GitHub Project Board Structure

Create these columns on your project board:

1. **To Do**
2. **Next Up** (priority items from To Do)
3. **In Progress**
4. **In Review**
5. **Done**

Place the new knowledge-driven issues in "Next Up" to prioritize them.

### Dependencies Between Issues

Make sure to note these important dependencies:

- Issue 3.2 (Data Agent) depends on Issue 2.5 (Neo4j Knowledge Graph)
- Issue 3.4 (Code Agent) depends on Issue 2.4 (Comprehensive Strategy Model)
- Issue 2.10 (Templates) depends on Issues 2.5 and 2.6 (Neo4j work)

## Implementation Order

I recommend implementing the new issues in this order:

1. Issue 2.4: Comprehensive Strategy Model Enhancement
2. Issue 2.5: Neo4j Knowledge Graph Enhancement
3. Issue 2.6: Strategy Repository Implementation
4. Issue 2.8: Knowledge-Based ValidationAgent (update existing ValidationAgent)
5. Issue 2.7: Knowledge-Driven ConversationalAgent
6. Issue 2.10: Strategy Templates System

This order ensures you build the foundation (model and knowledge graph) before updating the agents to use it.

## What to Keep from Existing Issues

Your existing GitHub issues already have valuable information. When updating:

1. Preserve any unique discussion or context
2. Keep assignees, labels, and linked PRs
3. Reference the original implementation plan where relevant
4. Maintain consistency with your current workflow
