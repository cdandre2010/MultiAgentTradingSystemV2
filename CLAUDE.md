## Code Style Guidelines
- **Architecture**: Agent-based with Master, Conversational, Validation, Data/Feature, Code, and Feedback agents (Master, Conversational, and Validation agents implemented; others planned)
- **Knowledge-Driven Approach**: ConversationalAgent constructs strategies by querying Neo4j for appropriate components, ValidationAgent verifies using relationship data
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with OAuth2 authentication, consistent error responses
- **Imports**: Group standard library â†’ third-party â†’ local with alphabetical sorting
- **Formatting**: Use Black with 88 character line length, isort for import sorting
- **Types**: Comprehensive type hints for all functions and return values
- **Naming**: snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings for public APIs
- **Error handling**: Custom exceptions with informative messages; log at appropriate levels
- **Testing**: Unit tests for all components, end-to-end tests for agent interactions
- **Database**: Separate data management layers for Neo4j, InfluxDB, and SQL databases
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication with refresh tokens and role-based permissions
- **Repository Pattern**: All database access through repository classes

## Development Workflow
1. Pick an issue from the project board
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/issue-number-description`
3. Implement the feature following TDD approach
4. Run tests and linting: `./run.sh test && ./run.sh lint`
5. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Issue #X: Description of changes"`
6. Push branch: `git push -u origin feature/issue-number-description`
7. Create pull request on GitHub
8. Update project board

## Database Management and Testing Tips

1. Neo4j Database Management:
   - To clear Neo4j database: `python clear_neo4j.py`
   - To initialize/reinitialize Neo4j: `python scripts/init_neo4j.py` 
   - Neo4j Configuration: 
     * Neo4j Desktop on Windows: Uses port 7689 (configured in Neo4j Desktop settings)
     * Docker Neo4j: Maps internal port 7687 to external port 7689 (configured in docker-compose.yml)
     * Both setups use same credentials: neo4j/SchoolsOut2025
     * Browser interface: http://localhost:7474 (login with neo4j/SchoolsOut2025)
   - Resetting Docker Neo4j completely:
     * `docker-compose down -v` (removes volumes)
     * `docker-compose up -d` (recreates container)
   - Run repository tests: `pytest tests/unit/test_strategy_repository.py -v`
   - Use `--log-cli-level=INFO` to see detailed logging during tests

2. Running tests on Windows:
   - Use correct virtual environment: `venv_win/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest ...` 
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed in the virtual environment
   - For Windows-specific issues with Neo4j, check connection settings and firewall
