# Multi-Agent Trading System V2

A conversational multi-agent AI trading system platform that allows users to define personalized trading strategies through a natural language interface, perform backtesting, and generate trading signals.

## Overview

This system uses a hybrid architecture with multiple specialized AI agents to guide users through the process of creating, testing, and monitoring trading strategies. It improves upon version 1 with enhanced calculation accuracy, better code generation, more interactive conversations, and a client-server architecture.

   - Created visualization tools for knowledge graph exploration

6. **Data/Feature Agent Implementation** âœ…
   - Created specialized agent for market data processing
   - Implemented comprehensive message handling for:
     - Technical indicator calculations
     - Market data retrieval
     - Data availability verification
     - Strategy data preparation
     - Visualization data formatting
   - Added integration with MasterAgent for message routing
   - Implemented proper async/sync handling for service methods
   - Created extensive test suite following TDD approach

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for database services)
- Anthropic API key (for Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultiAgentTradingSystemV2.git
   cd MultiAgentTradingSystemV2
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies
   ```
   python -m pip install -e .
   # or
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the database services
   ```
   cd docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Initialize the databases
   ```
   python -m src.database.init
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Set up environment variables in `.env` file
   ```
   # Example .env file
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   
   # External data sources API keys
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_api_key
   BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
   BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_api_secret
   ```

2. Start the backend server
   ```
   ./run.sh server
   # or
   uvicorn src.app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server (not implemented yet)
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

4. Visit the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Development Workflow

- **Code Style**: We use Black for Python formatting and ESLint for JavaScript
- **Testing**: Write tests for all new functionality using pytest
- **Version Control**: Follow the GitHub flow with feature branches and pull requests
