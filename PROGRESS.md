# Project Progress Tracker

## Current Focus: Basic Frontend and Visualization Components
We've successfully completed implementing the Data/Feature Agent and its integration with the ConversationalAgent. Our next priority is completing the basic frontend implementation before moving on to specialized visualization components.

The recent progress includes:
1. ‚úÖ Issue 3.1.1: Data Versioning and Audit System - Completed!
2. ‚úÖ Issue 3.1.2: Data Integrity and Adjustment Detection - Completed!
3. ‚úÖ Issue 3.1.3: Indicator Calculation Service - Completed!
4. ‚úÖ Issue 3.2: Data/Feature Agent Implementation - Completed!
5. ‚úÖ Issue 3.2.1: ConversationalAgent Integration with Data/Feature Agent - Completed!

With these essential backend components now in place, our focus shifts to:
1. üîÑ Issue 1.4: Basic Frontend Implementation - In Progress
2. üîÑ Issue 3.2.2: Frontend Visualization Components for Data/Feature Agent
3. üîÑ Code Generation Agent implementation
4. üîÑ Backtesting engine implementation

We need to complete Issue 1.4 (Basic Frontend) before implementing Issue 3.2.2 (Frontend Visualization Components) since we need the foundational React infrastructure in place first. This will provide the necessary structure for the specialized visualization components we plan to build.

These components create a robust foundation for market data processing, feature generation, and visualization, which are essential for strategy development and backtesting.
