# Trading Strategy System: Project Overview

## System Purpose
This multi-agent AI trading strategy system allows users to define personalized trading strategies through a conversational interface. The system guides users in creating strategies, validates them, performs backtesting, and enables real-time signal generation.

## Key Components

### Architecture Overview
The system uses a hybrid architecture with two main layers:

1. **Data Layer**
   - Neo4j graph database for structured data (strategy components, relationships)
   - InfluxDB for time-series market data (OHLCV)
   - SQLite/PostgreSQL for user accounts and metadata

2. **Agentic Layer**
   - Master Agent: Orchestrates workflow and coordinates other agents
   - Conversational Agent: Handles natural language dialogue with users
   - Validation Agent: Ensures strategies are valid and complete
   - Data/Feature Agent: Retrieves and processes market data
   - Code Agent: Generates executable strategy code
   - Feedback Agent: Analyzes results and suggests improvements

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Agentic Layer**: LangChain with Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- **Data Layer**: Neo4j, InfluxDB
- **Additional Technologies**: WebSockets, Python multiprocessing

## Core User Flows

1. **Strategy Creation**
   - User interacts with Conversational Agent
   - System guides through selection of components (strategy type, instrument, etc.)
   - Strategy is validated and stored

2. **Backtesting**
   - Historical data is processed for selected instrument/timeframe
   - Strategy is simulated against historical data
   - Results are analyzed and visualized
   - Feedback Agent suggests improvements

3. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - WebSockets deliver market data updates
   - Strategies generate signals based on real-time data
   - User receives notifications and visualizations

## Development Approach
- **Test Driven Development**: Each component begins with tests
- **Modular Design**: Components are independent and replaceable
- **Phased Implementation**: Building system in focused phases
- **Continuous Testing**: Automated testing throughout development

## Implementation Phases
1. **Setup and Core Components**: Environment, authentication, database schema
2. **Strategy Creation with Multi-Agent System**: Build agent architecture and conversation flows
3. **Data Handling and Backtesting**: Market data management and strategy testing
4. **Real-Time Data and Feedback**: Live data, enhanced UX, strategy improvements
5. **Security, Compliance, and Deployment**: Production readiness and scaling

## Key Technical Challenges
- Coordinating multiple AI agents for a coherent user experience
- Processing large time-series datasets efficiently
- Generating and optimizing valid trading strategy code
- Ensuring system security for financial application
- Scaling to handle multiple users and strategies
