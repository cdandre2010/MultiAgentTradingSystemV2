## Development Notes

### Strategic Decisions

1. **Knowledge Graph Approach** - The system uses Neo4j as a knowledge graph to store trading strategy components and their relationships. This enables the ConversationalAgent to construct strategies by querying appropriate components rather than starting from scratch, leading to more reliable and consistent strategy creation.

2. **Multi-Agent Architecture** - We chose a specialized agent approach where each agent has a specific role rather than a single large model. This provides better separation of concerns and makes the system more maintainable and extendable.

3. **Comprehensive Strategy Templates** - Trading strategies require many components beyond just indicators and signals, including backtesting configuration, position management, and performance measurement. The system's architecture now accounts for all these elements.

### Technical Insights

1. **Thread Safety** - SQLite connections needed thread-local storage to prevent concurrency issues in the FastAPI environment.

2. **LLM Integration** - Claude 3.7 Sonnet is used for both conversation and validation, leveraging different prompting techniques for each purpose.

3. **Model Evolution** - We've experienced challenges with model naming conventions as Claude models evolve - using the latest stable model names is important for production reliability.
