## Data Schema Design

### Measurement Structure

```
market_data
  |-- tags:
  |     |-- instrument: string (e.g., "BTCUSDT", "AAPL")
  |     |-- timeframe: string (e.g., "1m", "1h", "1d")
  |     |-- source: string (e.g., "binance", "yahoo")
  |     |-- version: string (e.g., "latest", "snapshot_123")
  |     |-- is_adjusted: boolean
  |
  |-- fields:
  |     |-- open: float
  |     |-- high: float
  |     |-- low: float
  |     |-- close: float
  |     |-- volume: float
  |     |-- adjustment_factor: float (if applicable)
  |     |-- source_id: string (reference to external ID)
  |
  |-- timestamps: RFC3339 timestamps
```

### Audit Metadata Structure

```
data_audit
  |-- tags:
  |     |-- instrument: string
  |     |-- timeframe: string
  |     |-- snapshot_id: string
  |     |-- strategy_id: string
  |
  |-- fields:
  |     |-- source_versions: string (JSON)
  |     |-- created_by: string (user ID)
  |     |-- purpose: string (e.g., "backtest", "live")
  |     |-- data_hash: string (for integrity verification)
  |
  |-- timestamps: RFC3339 timestamps
```

### Version Management

- "latest" tag represents the most up-to-date data
- Snapshots are created with unique IDs for backtesting
- Historical data points maintain both original and adjusted values
- Adjustment factors are stored for transparency
- Corporate actions are tracked in a separate metadata measurement

## Client Implementation

### InfluxDBClient Class

The client will provide:

- Version-aware CRUD operations for market data
- Data snapshot functionality for audit purposes
- Integrity verification methods
- Efficient query patterns with proper indexing
- Automatic handling of data gaps and adjustments

```python
class InfluxDBClient:
    """Client for interacting with InfluxDB with version awareness."""
    
    def __init__(self, url, token, org, bucket="market_data"):
        """Initialize the client with connection parameters."""
        
    def write_ohlcv(self, instrument, timeframe, data, source, version="latest"):
        """Write OHLCV data with versioning metadata."""
        
    def query_ohlcv(self, instrument, timeframe, start_date, end_date, version="latest"):
        """Query OHLCV data with version support."""
        
    def create_snapshot(self, instrument, timeframe, start_date, end_date, snapshot_id, strategy_id=None):
        """Create a point-in-time snapshot of data for audit purposes."""
        
    def check_for_adjustments(self, instrument, timeframe, reference_date):
        """Check if data has been adjusted since reference date."""
        
    def get_data_versions(self, instrument, timeframe):
        """Get available data versions for an instrument/timeframe."""
        
    def apply_retention_policy(self, policy_config):
        """Apply data retention policy based on configuration."""
```

## Services Architecture

The system will be organized into the following services:

### DataAvailabilityService

Responsible for:
- Checking if data exists for a specific instrument/timeframe
- Identifying missing data segments
- Calculating required data periods including lookback
- Analyzing data quality metrics

### DataIngestionService

Responsible for:
- Connecting to external API data sources
- Transforming data into standard format
- Detecting and handling data adjustments
- Applying data quality checks
- Tracking data provenance

### DataCacheService

Responsible for:
- Managing data versioning and snapshots
- Implementing priority-based source selection
- Handling incremental updates
- Applying data retention policies
- Coordinating data reconciliation

### IndicatorService

Responsible for:
- On-demand calculation of technical indicators
- Parameter flexibility for different strategy needs
- Calculation optimizations
- Session-based caching for performance
- Batch calculation capabilities

### DataIntegrityService

Responsible for:
- Periodic reconciliation with external sources
- Detecting corporate actions and adjustments
- Managing data correction workflows
- Providing data quality metrics
- Implementing notification system for discrepancies

### DataRetrievalService

Responsible for:
- Providing unified API for data access
- Supporting strategy data requirements
- Managing version-specific data retrieval
- Coordinating data preprocessing
- Integrating with indicator calculations

## Data Flow Patterns

### Initial Data Loading

1. User/system requests data for an instrument
2. DataAvailabilityService checks if data exists in InfluxDB
3. If missing, DataIngestionService fetches from external sources
4. DataCacheService stores the data with proper versioning
5. DataIntegrityService verifies the data quality

### Strategy Backtesting

1. Strategy requests data via DataRetrievalService
2. Service fetches raw OHLCV data from InfluxDB
3. DataCacheService creates a snapshot for audit
4. IndicatorService calculates required indicators
5. Complete dataset is provided to the strategy

### Data Update and Reconciliation

1. Scheduled job triggers data reconciliation
2. DataIntegrityService compares cached data with sources
3. If discrepancies found, adjustments are identified
4. New data version is created with adjustment metadata
5. Original data is preserved for audit purposes

## Versioning and Audit System

### Snapshot Creation

- Snapshots are created:
  1. Before strategy backtesting
  2. When a strategy is approved for live trading
  3. On user request for compliance purposes
  4. After significant market events

- Each snapshot includes:
  1. Unique identifier
  2. Reference to source data versions
  3. Purpose (backtest, approval, compliance)
  4. Data integrity hash
  5. User/system that created the snapshot

### Version Retrieval

- Data can be retrieved:
  1. Using "latest" for current data
  2. Using specific snapshot ID for historical data
  3. Using timestamp for point-in-time data
  4. Using strategy ID for strategy-specific data

### Audit Trail

- All data operations are logged:
  1. Data source and timestamp
  2. User/system performing the operation
  3. Purpose of the operation
  4. Before/after state for adjustments
  5. References to external triggers (corporate actions)

## Integrity and Adjustment Detection

### Reconciliation Process

1. Compare cached data with external sources
2. Identify potential discrepancies in values
3. Check for known corporate actions
4. Analyze patterns indicative of splits, dividends, etc.
5. Calculate adjustment factors when detected

### Adjustment Handling

1. Create new version with adjusted data
2. Preserve original data with appropriate tagging
3. Store adjustment factor and rationale
4. Update "latest" version
5. Notify relevant services/users

### Data Quality Metrics

- Completeness: Percentage of expected data points present
- Consistency: Variation from expected statistical patterns
- Timeliness: Lag between real-time and cached data
- Accuracy: Comparison with alternative sources
- Integrity: Hash verification of unchanged historical data

## Indicator Calculation

### On-Demand Calculation

1. Raw OHLCV data is fetched from InfluxDB
2. IndicatorService calculates indicators with specified parameters
3. Results are cached in memory for the session
4. Indicators are not persisted to InfluxDB
5. Calculation code is separated from data retrieval

### Indicator Types

- Trend: Moving averages, MACD, ADX, etc.
- Momentum: RSI, Stochastic, Rate of Change, etc.
- Volatility: Bollinger Bands, ATR, etc.
- Volume: OBV, Volume Profile, etc.
- Custom: User-defined indicators

### Optimization Techniques

- Vectorized calculations using NumPy
- Incremental calculations for streaming data
- Parallelization for batch processing
- Caching of intermediate results
- Adaptive algorithm selection based on data size
