# GitHub Issues for Knowledge-Driven Strategy Creation

## Issue 1: Comprehensive Strategy Model Enhancement

**Title**: Enhance strategy model with comprehensive trading components

**Description**:
The current strategy model needs to be expanded to include all components necessary for a complete trading strategy, including detailed position sizing, backtesting configuration, and trade management.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Add trade management options (stop types, partial exits)
- [ ] Add backtesting configuration (method, time windows)
- [ ] Add performance measurement criteria
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
- [ ] Add Pydantic validation for all new components
- [ ] Update tests to cover new model components

**Priority**: High

## Issue 5: ValidationAgent Neo4j Integration

**Title**: Enhance ValidationAgent with knowledge-based validation

**Description**:
Update the ValidationAgent to use Neo4j for validating strategy components and their relationships instead of relying solely on hard-coded rules.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Inject StrategyRepository into ValidationAgent
- [ ] Replace hard-coded validation rules with Neo4j queries
- [ ] Add relationship validation based on knowledge graph
- [ ] Implement compatibility scoring during validation
- [ ] Enhance suggestion generation with Neo4j alternatives
